Just a folder with some simple, test-passed, correctly done FCC's challenges. Please note each new challenge's increasing difficulty.

I'll place each chalenge's corresponding User Stories and also a working Codepen.io's pen in this very README file.


Disclaimers:
- I'll be uploading challenges as long as I finish them. Sorry if you look for something I didn't done (yet).
- SOC: I'm placing all my React components in the same file. I know this is a bad practice. I'm just doing it this way in order to make this projects work on Codepen.
